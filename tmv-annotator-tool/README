***********************************
Tools for the annotation of
Tense, Mood and Voice (TMV) for
English, French and German
***********************************

The annotation scripts are written in Python and do
not require any specific Python packages to be
installed.

The annotatation relies on the dependency parse trees
in the CoNLL format. The rules are developed and tested
on the output of the Mate dependency parser.
The parser and all the models can be downloaded from:
https://code.google.com/archive/p/mate-tools/wikis/ParserAndModels.wiki

For English, only the parsing model is required.
For French and German, the joint models for parsing/tagging/morphology,
as well as for the lemmatization are needed.

If you already have parsed data in the required format,
you can run the annotation script directly on your data.

The annotation script has three input parameters:
-i : input file name (parsed file in CoNLL format)
-l : language (en, fr, de)
-h : annotation in the html format (yes, no)

The annotation script generates a TSV file with annotations.
The output file name corresponds to the name of the input file
with the suffix ".verbs" and is stored in the subdirectory "output".
The annotations in the HTML format are also stored in the subdirectory
"output" and have the suffix ".verbs.html".

We provide parsed data for all three languages to test the annotation scripts.
They are stored in the subdirectory "data". To run the script, for example,
on the provided French data with the subsequent generation of the annotations
in the HTML format, run the following command:

sh annoTMV.sh -i data/fr.parsed -l fr -h yes

This will create two files in the subdirectory "output":
1) fr.parsed.verbs
2) fr.parsed.verbs.html
